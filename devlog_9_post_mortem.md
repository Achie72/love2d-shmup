# Devlog 9 + Post Mortem

Quick update before jumping into the post-mortem!
The last thing was to add a better gameplay loop experience with a highscore system and a better menu! For the Highscores I went with a retro type display, where you can select each letter one by one. The feature mostly is prominent in the yet not aviable binary exports, but runs fine in the we build, altough it will lose all points upon closing the game.

# Post Mortem

This was the first Devtober for me, but definietly not the last! Really enjoyed the challange and the community behind it and the daily/frequent devlogs will def stuck with me. Let's see where we are, and what we learned!

## State of the project:

The game is at a good MVP place. All basic features work, there is replayability and plenty of room to expand. It's enjoyable in my opinion and will get only better with some feedback and more time sinked in.

## What went wrong?

Switching engine mid Devtober was a stupid idea and hindered the project quite substantially, but I don't mind it in the end. Löve seems like a robust API to work with and the full open source nature of it will open up many possibilities to the project. Could we be further into features? Sure. There are still things that I wanted to put in the game, but either there is no good solution or there isn't any that resembeles the old TIC-80 version.

## What went right?

Talked about above, but even though I lost 2 weeks porting the game, Löve opened many possibilites for it. The audio engineer/musician that always helps me out can join once again a game making journey. The community was also amazing, providing awesome feedback from more eyes than I could ever imagine the project reaching!

## What's next?

For the moment the project will go into a feedback gathering pause state, at least until I finish my ["A Game By It's Cover"](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2022/topic/2445310/occult-nostalgia-devlog) entry, but possibly a bit more as the Christmas time will soon follow that deadline. Future updates are sure to come as I really enjoy the game and the idea itself, let's hope others will agree on this sentiment!
